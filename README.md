## User Story
```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Criteria
```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## My Experience

```
I had a ton of fun with this. Although the HTML and CSS were provided, I have had a lot of fun learning javascript so far. Being able to put this into practice was a ton of fun and I even decided to add an additional button to the page that allows the password to be copied to the clipboard. While this was not a part of the criteria, there was nothing saying that we couldn't add to it. It was something that I thought might be useful and thought that it be fun to add in the javascript. Overall I had a good experience with this!
